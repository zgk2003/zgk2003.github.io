      <h1>Guanaki Zhai</h1>
        <p> My research interest lies at the intersection between machine learning and traditional feedback controls.
          While data-driven methods such as computer vision and reinforcement learning produce astinishing results in some 
          areas as demonstrated by AlphaGo, they fail at producing reliable and consistent results in safety-critical 
          applications such as autonomous vehicles. Thus, I am passionate about incorporating classical feedback control 
          principles, which are 100% reliable with formal verification, into these data-driven methods."
        </p>
        <p>I'm currently a sophomore studying computer science at Cornell University. I am looking for research opportunities
          in machine learning, feedback controls, robotics, etc.

    <b>Cockpit Instruments: A Historical Study of the Ergonomic Considerations in Aircraft</b>
    <br>
    <b>Guankai Zhai</b>

    <a href="https://pioneeracademics.com/journals/"> Pioneer Journal 2019 </a>
    <br>
    <b>TL;DR</b>: We examined how the designs and layouts of cockpit instruments have evolved over the last century, 
    analyzed the ergonomic considerations of engineers from different times in history using the instruments they designed, 
    and proposed furture developments in the field of Crew Resource Management(CRM).
